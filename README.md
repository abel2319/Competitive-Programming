# ðŸš€ Competitive Programming

This repository contains my solutions to problems from various competitive programming platforms. It serves as a personal archive and reference for problem-solving techniques, algorithms, and data structures.

## Repository Structure

Each folder within this repository corresponds to a specific competitive programming platform. Inside each folder, you'll find my accepted solutions to problems from that platform.


> Note: Folder names may vary depending on the platform.

## Problem-Solving Goals

- Improve algorithmic thinking and problem-solving speed.
- Practice writing clean and efficient code.
- Learn and apply new data structures and algorithms.

## Platforms Covered

- [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)
- ...

## Notes

- Each solution is written in a language supported by the platform (mostly C++, Python, or Java).
- Filenames typically match the problem's identifier or title.
- Some problems may include a comment block with the problem link or a brief explanation.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are for learning and reference purposes only. If you're using this repo to study, try solving the problems on your own before looking at the code.
